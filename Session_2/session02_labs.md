### Hands-On Lab: Introduction to JavaScript

####  Online code editors:
1. MIMIC Project: [https://mimicproject.com/about](https://mimicproject.com/about)
2. CodePen: [https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/)

#### Objectives:
    1. Understand variables and conventions.
    2. Perform basic DOM manipulation.
    3. Implement simple accessibility enhancements.
#### Setup Instructions:
    1. Required software: text editor, web browser.
    2. Create project folder with `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.

#### Exercise 1: Variables and Conventions

**Task:** Create a JavaScript file (`script.js`) that declares variables for your name, age, and favorite hobby. Output these variables to the console.

#### Exercise 2: Simple Math Operations

**Exercise 2a: Addition**

**Task:** Implement JavaScript code that calculates the sum of two predefined numbers and outputs the result to the console.

 **Exercise 2b: Subtraction**

**Task:** Modify the previous code to calculate the difference between the same two numbers and output the result to the console.

**Exercise 2c: Multiplication**

**Task:** Extend the code to calculate the product of the two numbers and output the result to the console.

**Exercise 2d: Division**

**Task:** Further extend the code to calculate the quotient of the two numbers and output the result to the console.

#### Exercise 3 : Conditional Statements
**Task:** Write JavaScript code that checks if a given number is even or odd. Output the result to the console.

#### Exercise 4: Arrays and Loops

**Task:** Create JavaScript code that stores your favorite fruits in an array. Use a `for` loop to output each fruit to the console.

#### Exercise 5: Basic DOM Manipulation

 **Objective:** Learn how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.
 **Task:** Create a button and a paragraph in your existing HTML document. When the button is clicked, change the text content of the paragraph to display a personalized message.

#### Exercise 5: Basic Form Validation

**Objective:** Practice implementing basic form validation using JavaScript.
**Task:** Create a form with input fields for name and email. Validate that both fields are filled out when the form is submitted. Display an error message if any field is empty.

#### Exercise 6: Creating a To-Do List

1. HTML Structure: Basic HTML setup for the to-do list.
2. JavaScript Functions: Functions to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.
3. Event Listeners: Handling user interactions like adding or removing tasks.
