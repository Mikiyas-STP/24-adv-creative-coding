### Exercise 1.
Pick a social media or streaming platform. Looking at the UK GOV guidelines, can you think of how to improve its accessibility?

Try to improve the design using Figma.

### Exercise 2a.

<b> Please feel free to skip to part 2b if you're familiar with HTML & CSS. </b>

Take or write a short text. Feel free to use the prompts below. Aim for 3-5 paragraphs.

Using HTML and CSS, try to format the text as you would like it to look.
Feel free to use Figma to design it before coding it if you'd like.

<b>Try to use at least these 3 tags to format the text:</b>
- header \<h>
- paragraph \<p>
- div \<div>

<b>Try to use these things to style the text:</b>
- use a font from an external file.
- edit text colour and size.

<b>Once you've done that, try to add a link to another website in your text and:</b>
- style the fragment containing the link,
- style the same fragment differently while being hovered over (hover - while the cursor is over the object with the link).

<b>Text prompts:</b>

1. Write what you're hoping to achieve from this course, what about the course interests you the most, and what you're hoping to do with the newly gained skills and knowledge.

2. Write a bio for yourself for a personal website. What you can include:
- your achievements up-to-date,
- what you're interested in,
- what you're currently learning,
- what you would like to do in the future,
- what are your values in life and at work,
- what sort of projects you would like to work on,
- what sorts of collaboration you're open to.

3. Find a poem or book fragment online, or use a short piece of writing of your own if you have one.

### Exercise 2b.

Using the accessibility guidelines from class, try to adapt your design from Exercise 1a accordinly.

UK Government guidelines

UK Dyslexia Association guidelines:



### Exercise 3.

1. Go to Figma and try to start designing a wireframe for a website that will be the final project for this course.
If you're a beginner, I'd suggest to start with a single-page site.


The page could be your personal or portfolio website, a website for your or a friend's small business, a fan website, or anything else you like.
