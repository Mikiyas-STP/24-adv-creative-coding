### Figma - online tool for digital design and sharing files

https://www.figma.com/

### Exercise 1.
Pick a social media or streaming platform. Looking at the UK GOV guidelines, can you think of how to improve its accessibility?

Try to improve the design using Figma.

### Exercise 2a.

<b> Please feel free to skip to part 2b if you're familiar with HTML & CSS. </b>

Take or write a short text. Feel free to use the prompts below. Aim for 3-5 paragraphs.

Using HTML and CSS, try to format the text as you would like it to look.
Feel free to use Figma to design it before coding it if you'd like.

<b>Try to use at least these 3 tags to format the text:</b>
- header \<h>
- paragraph \<p>
- div \<div>

More HTML tags: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/

<b>Try to use these things to style the text:</b>
- use a font from an external file.
- edit text colour and size.

<b>Once you've done that, try to add a link to another website in your text and:</b>
- style the fragment containing the link,
- style the same fragment differently while being hovered over (hover - while the cursor is over the object with the link).

<b>Text prompts:</b>

1. Write what you're hoping to achieve from this course, what about the course interests you the most, and what you're hoping to do with the newly gained skills and knowledge.<br><br>

2. Write a bio for yourself for a personal website. What you can include:
- your achievements up-to-date,
- what you're interested in,
- what you're currently learning,
- what you would like to do in the future,
- what are your values in life and at work,
- what sort of projects you would like to work on,
- what sorts of collaboration you're open to.

3. Find a poem or book fragment online, or use a short piece of writing of your own if you have one.

### Exercise 2b.

Using the accessibility guidelines from class, try to adapt your design from Exercise 1a accordingly.

### Exercise 3.

1. Go to Figma and try to start designing a wireframe for a website that will be the final project for this course.
If you're a beginner, I'd suggest to start with a single-page site.


The page could be your personal or portfolio website, a website for your or a friend's small business, a fan website, or anything else you like.
